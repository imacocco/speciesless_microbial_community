# speciesless_microbial_community
Simple python code that reproduces the results obtained in the paper 'Theoretical microbial ecology without species' by Mikhail Tikhonov. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.96.032410

The classes and the functions are contained in the folder py_module. The file `patch.ipynb` contains the routine for the single patch and a brief explanation of the results for the multi patch simulations.
The folder `random` and `removed` contains the routine for the multi patch results and a couple of examples with different parameters

Don't know whether it is the best implementation of the code but it is pretty straightforward to understand
